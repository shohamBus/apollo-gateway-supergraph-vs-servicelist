# apollo-gateway-supergraph-vs-servicelist
Clearly states that the repository compares Apollo Gateway configurations using a supergraph file and a service list

Supergraph vs. Service List:

The first snippet uses a Supergraph file (supergraph.graphql) to define the composition of the graph.
The second snippet uses a service list, explicitly specifying the names and URLs of the services to be composed.
Dynamic vs. Static Composition:

The Supergraph file allows for dynamic composition, meaning you can change the composition without modifying the code. This is particularly useful in a microservices architecture where services might come and go.
The service list requires modification of the code whenever you add or remove services, making it a more static approach.
Deployment and Scaling:

Supergraph composition can be more flexible in a dynamic environment, where services may scale independently and have different endpoints.
Service list composition is simpler to set up but might be more rigid when it comes to dynamically changing services or endpoints.
Best Practices:

Supergraph Composition:

Best suited for dynamic environments where services can change frequently.
Enables better flexibility and adaptability in microservices architectures.
Service List Composition:

Simpler to set up and may be suitable for more static environments or when services don't change frequently.
Can be easier to understand for smaller projects or when the service structure is relatively stable.
Considerations:

Choose the approach based on the specific needs of your project, the frequency of changes to services, and the scalability requirements.
Supergraph composition is often preferred in larger, dynamic microservices architectures, while service list composition might be sufficient for smaller projects with more stable service structures.
